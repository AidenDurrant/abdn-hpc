## Unoffical guide for University of Aberdeen HPC Clusters

This repoository provides information and examples for using the University of Aberdeen HPC clusters Maxwell and Macleod. 

This guide is focussed on GPU accelerated Machine and Deep Learning with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and does not include instructions for CPU and high-memory computation.

### Macleod
The Macleod cluster is the University's own in-house HPC specifically dedicated to teaching and student research projects. All staff and students can access the cluster, staff can [request access here](https://forms.office.com/r/Fzukzia80T).

The `macleod/` directory of this repo contains a written introduction guide and example code to get started on using Macleod for GPU accelerated Machine Learning.

**Note:** Macleod should not be used for large-scale high compute projects. If you require more GPU resources consider Maxwell if you have access. 

### Maxwell
Coming soon...

### Todo:

- [ ] Add screenshots
- [ ] Add Maxwell guide
- [ ] Distritbuted computation guide
- [ ] Detailed / Advanced user guides
